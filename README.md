# Dynamic SplashScreen Animation in Flutter
Welcome to this Flutter project repository, where you'll find a dynamic splash screen implementation using Lottie animations. This application showcases a customizable splash screen that enhances the user experience by providing a visually appealing start to the app.

## Features
- **Customizable Splash Screen**: The splash screen can be easily customized to fit the branding and style of your app.
- **Lottie Animations**: For a smooth and engaging animation, Lottie files are used, which can be replaced with your own animations.
- **Asynchronous Operations**: The code includes an example of how to perform asynchronous operations, such as fetching a token from an API before navigating to the main page.
- **Seamless Navigation**: After the splash screen, the app navigates to the main page without any user input required.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, clone the repository and ensure you have all the necessary dependencies installed. Run the app on your preferred emulator or physical device to see the splash screen in action.

## Customization
You can customize the splash screen by replacing the Lottie animation files with your own. Adjust the duration of the splash screen or the asynchronous operations to match your app's requirements.

## Code Explanation
- `main.dart`: Initializes the app with `MyApp` as the root widget, setting up the theme and home screen.
- `SplashScreen.dart`: Contains the `SplashScreen` widget that displays the Lottie animations and handles the navigation to `MyHomePage` after a set duration.
- `MyHomePage.dart`: A placeholder for the main content of your app, which is displayed after the splash screen.

Feel free to use this code as a starting point for your own projects and customize it to suit your needs. Happy coding!
